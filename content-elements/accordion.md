Now user has main "Group of collapsibles" container and few "Collapsible content" containers (headers of elements). Next step - to creat content element. In every "Collapsible content" container click "Create a new content element".  Here user can add any content element that is needed. For example, it can be "Text and Media" element, "Icon, Text and Button" element, "Responsive Video" element etc (to see how to create content elements click on them). Repeat it with all "Collapsible content" containers. Accordion element is created.
